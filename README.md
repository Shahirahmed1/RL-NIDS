# RL-NIDS-Project

This project focuses on implementing a Reinforcement Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (RL-NIDS). The goal is to enhance network security by detecting and mitigating malicious activities using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes RL algorithms to detect network intrusions.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different network environments.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large-scale network traffic.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RL-NIDS-Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd RL-NIDS-Project
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
2. Test the model:
    ```bash
    python test.py
    ```
